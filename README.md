# ISTAT_HealthAnalysis
Analysis of data coming from ISTAT research on health conditions. The idea is to check whether one can guess a possible health problem from generic information from the ISTAT questionnaire.

### To-do list
Here is a rough list of items to be covered:
1. Understand of the dataset we have:
   * [ ] make a list of possible sensitive variables 
   * [ ] estimate separation - possible cut and count outcome performance
   * [ ] look at other interesting variables (or combination)
   * [ ] make a list of input variables

2. Setting up the NN
3. Performance optimisation
4. Cheers :)
